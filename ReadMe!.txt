How to Play:
- CREATE 'replays' folder in the same directory as 
  'TicTacToe.exe'
- Requires a keyboard to play!
- Follow the in-game instructions for how to
  use each screen. Generally each screen looks
  for certain inputs, such as 'play' on the 
  initial game screen to play a game. All 
  commands for any given screen should be 
  shown on either the main screen or the 
  screen that the commands are used on.
- 'allReplays.txt' will be created after first 
  game's name entry is confirmed.
- Please DO NOT edit allReplays.txt or any of 
  the files within the replays folder, 
  modification to these files may corrupt the
  edited file's content and may make the replays
  system un-usable.

  How to Compile:
- Open any C compatible compiler.
- Navigate to this directory 
  (CD ~your path~/C_TicTacToe).
- Compile with 'cl TicTacToe.c'.
- 'replays' Folder MUST be created if it does not
  already exist in the same directory as 
  'TicTacToe.c' and 'TicTacToe.exe'
- Compiled game can now be launched with 
  either 'TicTacToe' in the compiler or by 
  clicking TicTacToe.exe file.
